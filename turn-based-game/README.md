You will be building a turn based battle game. If you're familiar with older video games, think of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. The UI can be very very basic, just some headings for names and info, a dropdown, and a couple of buttons. If you have no idea what any of this means,

- The player should be able to either "Fight" or "Use Magic", or some similar setup. Each player type should have different types of attack and/or magic.

- Make the game play cycle between two players Player 1 -> Enemy -> Player 2 -> Enemy
- Implement "ailments", e.g. being poisoned makes you weaker, being put to sleep makes you skip your turn

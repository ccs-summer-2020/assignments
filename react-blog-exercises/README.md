Complete the five apps, copying code from previous assignments only when absolutely necessary.

- a) Create a form that saves a blog post to state. The post
  should have a title and a body. It does not need to display blog posts, just
  save them.

- b) Create a form for a person. It should have a first name, last name,
  address, and phone number.  It should save the person to state.

- c) Create a "blog reading app", where you have a list of blog posts on the
  side and when you click on a post title, it opens that post on the right.
  Hint: which blog post is selected is "application state".

- d) Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form
  where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all
  the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated
  dynamically from the link array). When you click on a tag, the link list
  should show only those tags. Hint: which tag is selected is "application
  state". You can filter a collection with `Array.prototype.filter(...)`.

- e) Create a complete blog CMS from scratch, allowing you to create, read,
  update, and delete blog posts.
